# The-Lord-of-The-RNN

Project of an RNN to generate texts similar to those of Tolkien.

I was a student of the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course, so I picked up the following code as a base to this project: [Intro To RNNs - Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/intro-to-rnns).

In this project I used the following books: “The Hobbit”, “The Silmarillion” and “The Lord of The Ring”. I can not share this books, so... I'm sorry. Despite that, I left the checkpoints for anyone to use.

If you use my checkpoints, please share this GitHub project or the article in Medium ([The Lord of The RNN](https://medium.com/@taleslimaf/the-lord-of-the-rnn-52b937e4af93)).
